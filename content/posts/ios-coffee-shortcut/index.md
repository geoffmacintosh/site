I've not really used iOS Shortcuts before, but I finally started playing around with them, and I'm glad I did, as they're very good. My first shortcut is a [Coffee-making thing (iOS Shortcut link)](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/b8f83f1958dc44368598a6928f40efe3). It calculates how much coffee grounds you need for however much water you've decided to use, adds your caffeine intake to the Health app, and starts a timer.

I often want to make different amounts of French Press coffee and I can never remember how much coffee I should use, so I have the shortcut do some basic math for me. I use a brewing ratio of 17:1, based on [Phil & Sebastian's](https://philsebastian.com/pages/french-press-brewing-guide) 16:1 and [49th Parallel's](https://49thcoffee.com/blogs/brew-guides/french-press?%5Fpos=1&%5Fsid=8be973e3f&%5Fss=r) 16.6:1 suggestions. [Analog](https://www.analogcoffee.ca/blogs/brew-basics-step/french-press) suggests a much more leniant 15--20:1 ish ratio.

After reminding me how much coffee I need to use, the shortcut adds 145mg of caffeine to the Health app (assuming I didn't pick the decaf option). This is based on a searching a few dozen different sites, all of which have different numbers---[Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/how-much-caffeine-in-coffee#section2) suggests from 0--500mg per cup, for example. 145mg seems like a decent average per cup, obviously not accounting for the variation of bean, roast, coffee strength, actual amount drunk, or any of that. I don't bother to do math here, as if I make a big pot it's for two people. I figure the value in tracking this is if I drink more coffee, or drink coffee later in the day and see a change in my sleep duration, I'll be know what's up. The actual amount of caffeine is not the most important factor. If I drank a lot of other things with caffeine I'd probably need to set up a more sophisticated system to track them.

Finally, the shortcut starts a timer for four minutes, which is the correct amount of time to steep French Press coffee according to all the guides I previously linked to. Enjoy!
