Hi, I'm Geoff MacIntosh. This is my weird blog, which doesn't have any particular focus. It is made with some combination of [Emacs](https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus), [Org-mode](https://orgmode.org), [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). The [blog's source](https://github.com/geoffmacintosh/site) is on GitHub.


## Elsewhere {#elsewhere}

I post a lot of dog pictures on Instagram. You could also email me at my first name at this domain. I like email.
